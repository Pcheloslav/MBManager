The application is designed for commercial enterprises that have a problem with working with voltage data and adjusting lighting throughout the territory
The application is designed to read current and voltage data, remotely control the power grid, store this data and conveniently monitor it.
It can significantly facilitate the work of electricians in the enterprise by centralizing the management of the power grid. This is a prototype. To work with the app you need a ModBus controller otherwise it won't work. Though I'm not sure if it will work at all :)
